## Long-term Depression

We are going to utilize the `data(field)` data set. This data set is an example of a LTD~LFS~ experiment run in the ChristieLab. Follow along with how this data set is built in the `importABF()` vignette. The script to build and assign the data set as example data is `run/dataset_field.R`

After importing the data we have a data set that represents a complete LTD experiment with summary traces. 

```{r}
names(field)
knitr::kable(field$md)
```
