# The nphys package

The nphys package provides a means to import, manage, and analyze your
neurophysiology data collected during electrophysiology experiments. It
is geared towards developing robust and portable data management tools
and analysis methods. It also serves as a tool that encourages regularly
revisiting data by helping to manage large datasets and present
comprehensive summaries that can be rapidly updated and opvserved from
many different angles. This project is currently geared towards field
long-term depression (LTD) experiments and whole-cell patch-clamp
experiments, but will continue to be updated as more example datasets
and methodologies become available.

Detailed examples of how to utilize this package will be outlined in
vignettes as they are updated.
